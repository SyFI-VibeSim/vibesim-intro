A closer look showed that attention tensor parallelism had already replicated the hidden states across all four ranks. The extra dispatch was unnecessary. I replaced it with FlashInfer's native expert filtering: each rank computes its local experts, followed by an all-reduce. Kernel launches fell from 150 to 55 per rank in the one-layer trial.

I then moved attention-output quantization into the FA3 epilogue. A paired test with five requests per variant reduced median TTFT from 600.17 to 596.74 ms.
